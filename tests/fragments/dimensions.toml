# three things to note:
#   1.  'all' never has to be declared, it is provided for you
#   2.  ordering of {instances} within a dimension is not important
#   3.  a dimension does not need to contain any {instances}, or every
#       {instance} you are going to use

# a dimension can be declared without any inheritance details;
# this just means all product instances only inherit from 'all'
